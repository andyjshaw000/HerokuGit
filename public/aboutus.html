              <h2>June 2021</h2>
              <p>
                This month was when we first started talking. We started going to
                the gym together and getting Menchie's afterwards. We also really
                enjoyed skating together. We'd also go to Round One a lot with the group.

              <h2>July 2021</h2>
              <p>
                This month was when I started liking you. You introduced me to
                bouldering and I remember telling myself that I couldn't have
                these feelings for you. I also remember trying to step up my skating game
                to try and impress you. This was the month when we ran around
                Green Lake, walked the Seattle Pier, painted at Edmonds, went
                to UW/ Lake Union late at night, made s'mores, got Indian food,
                was my first time coming over to eat pho after
                Lake Blanca, and climbed Gas Works.

              <h2>Beginning of August 2021</h2>
              <p>
                This has to be split into parts because this was a hectic month
                for us. This was when I would start coming over often to watch
                movies with you. Your birthday had happened, and I ended up
                staying at your house to play Cooking Mama and hung out with
                your siblings for the first time playing Catan.

              <h2>August 9th, 2021</h2>
              <p>
                On this day we went bouldering together and got Fremont Bowl to
                eat at a park. Afterwards, we really wanted desert and you
                suggested we get Snowy Village. We ended up going back to your
                house that day to watch The Grudge, Curious George, and Howl's
                Moving Castle... Then I told you I liked you. It was scary and
                I remember the night before preparing what I would say to you. The next day, we
                met at Zumiez and you told me you had never thought of me like that. It had really
                hurt my feelings, but your concerns and feelings were valid and
                I knew that I would still want to be your friend.
                We went to Chic-Fil-A, Round the Table, and skated afterwards, but
                it was slightly awkward for me.

              <h2>August 22nd, 2021</h2>
              <p>
                Despite feelings not being reciprocated, we still hung out.
                I went to Uyen's house to play Codenames with you guys
                after playing soccer, we got Cafe Rio after going to
                Richmond Beach and then watched Shrek 2 and did a puzzle, we
                even got Jack in the Box and pushed each other around in a
                shopping cart. Then, we went to the Airbnb with pp party.
                I remember you going out to look for me and feeling happy that
                you went out of your way to do that. I wasn't ready
                to have the conversation with you about us. However, this
                was when you told me you liked me back. I found out that you
                had feelings for me since July and that you asked for advice
                from your neighbor about what to do. Although we both had the
                same feelings for each other, it was difficult to decide what
                to do with those feelings. We settled on trying to work on
                ourselves and being very casual.

              <h2>August 27th, 2021</h2>
              <p>
                Our nerves about our future together led to our Zumiez meet
                up once again to set ground rules and confirm our feelings.
                I remember feeling so ecstatic when I found out that you liked
                me back... and on the 27th, we began our "ooching". We got
                black bean noodles at Sahm Gook Jih and ate at Esperance
                Park, began telling people about us, had Menchie's,
                played We're Not Really Strangers, drew the scene of us at
                the park and watched Good Will Hunting. It was our first time
                doing something as a couple and not as friends.

              <p>
                This was a super cute day. This is when you told me you had a
                surprise for me and I met you at a park in Edmonds to eat
                Panda Express. This was also the day we went to Build-a-Bear to first order
                our Froggys! We went back to my place and built our Daiso dinosaur,
                made a peach cobbler, and watched Hereditary. This was also
                the day you tried hickory barbecue chips for the first time
                and my mac and cheese concoction with hot dogs.

              <p>
                Things were amazing up to this point. We went to a band rally,
                walked around downtown Seattle late at night, painted at an art
                studio, had your salmon butter baked dish, and explored West Seattle.
                This was when I remember getting the text to meet you outside my house
                and we ended our "ooching" and went back to being friends. It wouldn't
                be until the 16th that we would see each other in person again and the
                17th in Portland that I would tell you that I was okay with waiting
                for you to be ready for a relationship.

              <h2>October 29th - November 1st, 2021</h2>
              <p>
                Although I wasn't sure what our status was, I knew that I at least
                wanted to be friends with you if you wanted to just stay as friends.
                The 29th was my birthday which was a blast going to a trampoline park together,
                exploring Tacoma tasting Ramen and playing at Chuck-e-Cheese. The 31st
                was Halloween and I broke down trying to act okay around everyone and this
                was when we sat down and had our talk about your decision. You said
                that you would decide the next day and after some talking and deliberation
                in the car outside the pp house, we ended up finally being an official relationship
                on the 1st of November.

              <h2>Today</h2>
              <p>
                Ever since that day, things have been amazing. We have had some minor issues,
                but they're always resolved quickly because of how we communicate. We
                have had so many fun days and great dates and I am so excited for
                more to come. We have done so many fun things together like going to escape rooms,
                going to the Seattle Ferris Wheel, having sleep overs, snowboarding,
                playing Guilty Party, going to Discovery Park and Pike Place,
                having a drawing competition, playing Overcooked, celebrating your mom's birthday,
                and so much more. Despite all the hiccups, I wouldn't trade any of those experiences
                for the world. Thank you for everything, Trinh. I can't wait to
                see what our future is like!
